# Iris Flower Classification

This repository contains the code and resources for a project focused on classifying iris flowers into three species—**Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**—using machine learning techniques. The project explores different classifiers to determine which model best predicts the species of an iris flower based on its physical attributes.

## Overview

The Iris flower dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning. It consists of 150 samples from each of three species of Iris (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica). Four features were measured from each sample: the lengths and the widths of the sepals and petals. The objective of this project is to create a model that accurately classifies the species of iris flowers based on these features.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 150 samples with the following features:

- **Sepal Length** (cm)
- **Sepal Width** (cm)
- **Petal Length** (cm)
- **Petal Width** (cm)
- **Species**: The class label with three possible values: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

### Files

- `iris.csv`: The dataset file containing the iris flower data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-flower-classification.git
    cd iris-flower-classification
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The Exploratory Data Analysis phase involves visualizing the dataset to understand the distribution of features and the relationships between them. The analysis includes:

- Pairplots to visualize the relationships between features.
- Distribution plots to understand the spread of each feature.
- Correlation matrix to see how features correlate with each other.

The analysis is documented in `notebooks/EDA.ipynb`.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is minimal in this dataset due to its simplicity. The key steps include:

- Normalization of the features to ensure all of them contribute equally to the model.
- Encoding the target variable (Species) as it is categorical.

These processes are implemented in `src/data_preprocessing.py`.

## Modeling

The project explores several classification algorithms to determine the best model for classifying the iris species, including:

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes

The models are trained, and hyperparameters are tuned to achieve the best performance. The model training process is detailed in the `notebooks/Modeling.ipynb` notebook.

## Evaluation

Models are evaluated based on:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix

The evaluation results are provided in the `notebooks/Modeling.ipynb` notebook.

## Usage

To preprocess the data, train models, and make predictions, use the following commands:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
    ```bash
    python src/data_preprocessing.py
    ```

2. **Model Training**:
    ```bash
    python src/model.py
    ```

3. **Prediction**:
    ```bash
    python src/model.py --predict
    ```

## Results

The final model achieved an accuracy of **X%** on the test set. The results indicate that **Model X** performed the best among the classifiers explored. The model effectively differentiates between the three species of iris flowers.
